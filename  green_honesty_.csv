Carbon Neutral
A first for Apple.
A major step toward 2030.




As our first carbon neutral product, Apple Watch marks a milestone in our plan to make all our products carbon neutral by 2030. We’re cutting the majority of emissions through innovations in materials, clean electricity, and low-carbon shipping. And we’re investing in nature-based projects to offset the small amount that remains. Because the earth won’t wait. Neither will we.

Apple reports data about the recycled content of its products at different levels of fidelity, based on the level of independent data verification. The bulk of Apple’s recycled content data is certified and thus verified by an independent third party. Less than 5% of the total mass shipped in Apple products in fiscal year 2022 contains recycled content that is either supplier verified, meaning it has been reported by the supplier and cross-checked by Apple, or supplier reported, meaning it has been reported by the supplier based on production and allocation values. In all cases, Apple defines recycled content in alignment with ISO 14021. We do not currently include industry-average recycled content, which may result in underreporting actual recycled content. Total recycled material shipped in products is driven by product material composition and total sales — as a result, this overall recycled or renewable content percentage may fluctuate based on the number and type of products sold each year.

Carbon-neutral: Are Apple's green pledges the real deal or just greenwashing?
A person tries on an Apple Watch during an announcement of new products on the Apple campus, 12 September 2023, in Cupertino, California.

While Apple's actions are positive, they do not solve the problem of e-waste, experts say.

Last Tuesday, at its long-expected annual keynote, Apple spent some time recalling its climate goals and taking stock of its emissions and energy-saving achievements. 

In addition to the new iPhone 15, the Californian company presented the latest model of its smartwatch. As well as showcasing its newest features, Apple assured customers that this is its first 'carbon-neutral' product.

Messages in favour of the environment and a commitment to the green transition made up a large part of the presentation.


This included emphasis on the use of more recycled materials in the new iPhone. It also underlined its manufacturer's commitments to reduce emissions and intention to make all products carbon-neutral by 2030.

At a time when the climate crisis is becoming increasingly palpable, the California-based company wants the public to see it as a sustainable choice in technology.

It even put out a video in which Apple workers, including CEO Tim Cook himself, summarise their achievements and goals in a meeting with Mother Earth, played by Oscar-winning actress Octavia Spencer.


Given this boast of environmental ambition, many are asking: is this all just another greenwashing operation? Can Apple's business model really be environmentally sustainable?

Apple’s first 'carbon-neutral' device
The new Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2, as well as the previous SE model, have been presented as 'carbon-neutral' devices, from production to selling. In environmental reports, Apple explains how it has calculated the emissions to be able to claim this.

The company uses the kilograms of carbon emitted in its products’ different phases of life as its basis, from the materials to transportation.

It also includes the electricity consumed, both in the manufacture of the smartwatches - which accounts for most of the emissions - and that used by customers to recharge them at home.

Taking all this into account, Apple claims to have achieved neutrality in two ways: by reducing emissions where they can act directly and by offsetting them where they can’t.

Sick of buying a new phone every two years? Fairphones last for years and don’t exploit miners
iPhone 15 release date: How much energy will you save by not buying the new model?
The former, according to its own reports, has been achieved in three ways. By using 100 per cent clean electricity in its manufacturing processes, prioritising transportation by sea and other means instead of by air, and increasing the amount of recycled and sustainable materials in its devices.

Apple says it will also stop using leather in its bands and cases, due to the high environmental cost of the livestock industry.

The remaining emissions are offset with carbon credits in environmental projects which, the company says, meet international standards to be real and quantifiable.

""Carbon credits applied are retired after the end of each fiscal year, to correspond to the remaining emissions from the total number of products sold in the prior fiscal year,"" Apple explains.

Is Apple's green strategy really sustainable?
Although the tech company has been bragging for years about being environmentally conscious in its products, some detractors see these ads as yet another greenwashing operation.

The very concept of 'carbon-neutral' has been called into question because of the confusion it creates for some consumers.

""There is no such thing as a carbon-neutral product,"" David Ho, climate scientist and professor at the University of Hawaii, told Wired magazine.

""It’s kind of silly. It gives consumers the idea that there are ways out of these problems that don’t involve consuming less,"" Ho considers.

The expert jokes on Twitter that unless the new Apple Watch absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere, the 'carbon-neutral' label is nothing more than marketing.


One of the main criticisms of 'carbon-neutral' products and services is that, while they can reduce the environmental impact of their production phase, they still rely on carbon credits, externalising emissions through investments in green projects such as reforestation.

This strategy has been questioned by environmental organisations such as the NewClimate Institute.

“Recent scientific literature has demonstrated again and again that the real impacts associated with carbon crediting projects is far inferior to what their labels suggest,” the non-profit organisation says.

“Due to natural or human-induced disturbances such as forest fires, land degradation or land-use change, carbon storage in forestry and land-use projects is likely to only be temporary, and therefore in no way comparable with not having emitted greenhouse gases in the first place.”

Is it better to reuse rather than recycle?
Given that the best way to reduce emissions is not to emit them in the first place, increasing the lifespan of our devices remains the best way to reduce their environmental footprint.

A 2019 study by the European Environmental Bureau noted that increasing the lifespan of our phones and other devices by just one year would reduce carbon emissions in the EU by as much as removing 2 million cars from our roads.

According to the network of environmental citizens’ organisations, some 211 million phones are sold each year in the EU. On average, they are used for just three years before being replaced by new models.

So even if tech companies increase their environmental commitments, extending the use of our devices is still the most sustainable option.

Don't Fall For Apple's Greenwashing
Carbon-neutral, my ass.

WILL LOCKETT
14 SEPT 2023

Photo by Daniel Cañibano on Unsplash
A few days ago, Apple did yet another one of its swanky launch events. The main focus of this one was the upcoming iPhone 15 and its EU-compliant USB-C port (RIP lightning port). But hidden among the pomp and excitement was something truly worrying: Apple’s next Apple Watch. The product itself is absolutely fine, if a bit expensive. But the problem has nothing to do with the watch itself; instead, it lies in Apple’s carbon-neutral claims about the watch. You see, Tim Cook and the gang have engaged in some genuinely moronic greenwashing. Let me explain.

Let’s start off by acknowledging that Apple’s sustainability efforts have actually been okay. Their products have a longer operational life than most of their competitors. I use a 4-year-old iPhone, which runs great and uses the latest operating system; I couldn’t say the same if I used an Android. The same can be said for their iPads, computers and watches. This long life means Apple contributes less to e-waste, has a small manufacturing carbon footprint, and a smaller mining footprint (at least in theory). Apple also has a decent recycling scheme, although it isn’t as widespread and available as it should be.

** Quick interruption, if you want more from me, or interact with me, go follow me on Bluesky**

But the big feather in Apple’s sustainability cap is their carbon emissions and profit. Their annual emissions peaked in 2015 when they emitted 38.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. That year, Apple made a whopping 53.39 billion dollars in profit! 7 years later (2022), they emitted 46.35% less emissions at 20.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, yet their annual profits have soared to a staggering 99.8 billion dollars! This means Apple has successfully and dramatically decoupled growth from emissions, a critical step towards sustainability.

These are all steps in the right direction. But Apple is still miles away from true sustainability.

So, when Apple announced they were creating carbon-neutral products, my curiosity peaked. How have they made such a giant leap forward? Well, they hadn’t.

In the announcement, they stated that specific case and band combinations of the Apple Watch Series 9, Ultra 2 and SE will be entirely carbon-neutral and labelled and advertised as such. They went on to say they had done this by reducing emissions from materials, electricity, and transportation in the production of the watches. One of the main ways they have done this is to pressurise their supply chain to use renewable energy — though I have yet to find out if this is genuine renewable energy or renewable energy credits. Any remaining pollution will be offset through nature-based projects like restoring forests and increasing their carbon capacity. Furthermore, Apple will also offset the electricity the consumer will use to charge the device by buying carbon credits that fund renewable energy infrastructure.

All sounds good, right? Well, it turns out the carbon offsetting Apple is doing here is more than a little dubious.

Let’s start with the odd one: renewable energy infrastructure carbon credits. On the surface, these seem like an innocuous and obvious way to reduce and offset emissions, but they aren’t. They don’t pull carbon out of the atmosphere; they merely reduce the carbon that will enter the atmosphere in the future, and not by all that much. This is why this offsetting approach can’t be used to reach net-zero. Furthermore, renewable energy isn’t a charitable cause that needs funding like this. It is a vastly profitable industry that fossil fuel energy companies need to transition into by spending their hundreds of billions of dollars of expansion money on, rather than investing in yet more oil fields. So, in a roundabout way, renewable energy infrastructure carbon credits are allowing fossil fuel companies to continue expanding their planet-wrecking ways rather than transitioning as they should. All of this is why experts say this type of carbon credit is utter junk and means nothing.

Now let’s look at the other offsetting method, Natural carbon credits. These pay to restore and expand natural carbon-rich environments like rainforests or mangroves to pull carbon out of the atmosphere. In theory, they work and do good, but they are incredibly dubious for carbon-neutral claims. You see, calculating how much carbon is stored is incredibly difficult and susceptible to cherry-picking, meaning the carbon credits linked to these practices are not verifiable or reliable. What’s more, these ecosystems don’t have the capacity to store enough carbon to truly help us reach net-zero. These natural carbon sinks are also vulnerable to collapse and carbon release from things like wildfires and even earthquakes, so they aren’t a safe form of carbon storage either.

So, claiming a product or service is carbon-neutral due to natural-derived carbon credits is incredibly inaccurate and misleading.

For example, a study looked into 40 large corporations that claimed to have carbon-neutral services or products thanks to natural carbon credits to see what their actual carbon footprint was. Unsurprisingly, they found that they had only reduced their emissions by 36%, and their carbon credits’ value (the total carbon captured) was wildly inaccurate.

This is why bodies like the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMI), which ensures organisations who join them report carbon correctly, have stated that Carbon credits like this cannot be used for offsetting emissions instead of reducing emissions within corporate value chains or for making ‘carbon-neutral’ claims. Basically, Offsetting like this is not a substitute for decarbonisation.

The law is even catching up with this scientific viewpoint. In the UK, it will soon be illegal to claim and advertise a product as carbon-neutral through offsets unless the company can prove and verify its credibility. This means that in the UK, Apple can’t sell the Apple Watch as carbon-neutral, as you can’t verify natural carbon credits.

But there are carbon offsetting methods you can verify, such as Climeworks Direct Air Capture (DAC) systems. Third parties have verified them, so when you pay to offset one tonne of carbon dioxide, that is how much is pulled from the air. So why doesn’t Apple just use this type of offsetting?

Well, DAC technology is far more expensive than natural carbon credits, pricing it out of even Apple’s reach. What’s more, the annual capacity of DAC technology is tiny, at only 10,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. So even if Apple scooped up every single DAC-derived carbon credit out there (most of which isn’t verified like Climeworks), then they can only offset 0.05% of their emissions. In other words, there probably aren’t enough DAC carbon credits in the world for Apple to make the Apple Watch verifiably carbon-neutral.

It’s a damn shame that a company like Apple feels the need to sully its already decent (but not good enough) sustainability record with such transparent greenwashing. There are so many better ways to show your efforts towards sustainability than undermining your own credibility like this. For example, if they joined the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative, the massive efforts they have put into reducing the actual emissions from products like the Apple Watch can be better highlighted and marketed with integrity and honesty. Surely, that is a better way of going forward, rather than trying to dupe consumers?

Will.

No single company can produce a product without any emission or discharge.

We are very dependent on fossil fuels and will be for decades to come. Whether in sourcing synthetics for everything, using it to mine for minerals, or for travel.

Rather than fret over the release of CO2 we should adapt to the changing physical world.

Apple reports data about the recycled content of its products at different levels of fidelity, based on the level of independent data verification. The bulk of Apple’s recycled content data is certified and thus verified by an independent third party. Less than 5% of the total mass shipped in Apple products in fiscal year 2022 contains recycled content that is either supplier verified, meaning it has been reported by the supplier and cross-checked by Apple, or supplier reported, meaning it has been reported by the supplier based on production and allocation values. In all cases, Apple defines recycled content in alignment with ISO 14021. We do not currently include industry-average recycled content, which may result in underreporting actual recycled content. Total recycled material shipped in products is driven by product material composition and total sales — as a result, this overall recycled or renewable content percentage may fluctuate based on the number and type of products sold each year.

Carbon-neutral: Are Apple's green pledges the real deal or just greenwashing?
A person tries on an Apple Watch during an announcement of new products on the Apple campus, 12 September 2023, in Cupertino, California.

While Apple's actions are positive, they do not solve the problem of e-waste, experts say.

Last Tuesday, at its long-expected annual keynote, Apple spent some time recalling its climate goals and taking stock of its emissions and energy-saving achievements. 

In addition to the new iPhone 15, the Californian company presented the latest model of its smartwatch. As well as showcasing its newest features, Apple assured customers that this is its first 'carbon-neutral' product.

Messages in favour of the environment and a commitment to the green transition made up a large part of the presentation.


This included emphasis on the use of more recycled materials in the new iPhone. It also underlined its manufacturer's commitments to reduce emissions and intention to make all products carbon-neutral by 2030.

At a time when the climate crisis is becoming increasingly palpable, the California-based company wants the public to see it as a sustainable choice in technology.

It even put out a video in which Apple workers, including CEO Tim Cook himself, summarise their achievements and goals in a meeting with Mother Earth, played by Oscar-winning actress Octavia Spencer.


Given this boast of environmental ambition, many are asking: is this all just another greenwashing operation? Can Apple's business model really be environmentally sustainable?

Apple’s first 'carbon-neutral' device
The new Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2, as well as the previous SE model, have been presented as 'carbon-neutral' devices, from production to selling. In environmental reports, Apple explains how it has calculated the emissions to be able to claim this.

The company uses the kilograms of carbon emitted in its products’ different phases of life as its basis, from the materials to transportation.

It also includes the electricity consumed, both in the manufacture of the smartwatches - which accounts for most of the emissions - and that used by customers to recharge them at home.

Taking all this into account, Apple claims to have achieved neutrality in two ways: by reducing emissions where they can act directly and by offsetting them where they can’t.

Sick of buying a new phone every two years? Fairphones last for years and don’t exploit miners
iPhone 15 release date: How much energy will you save by not buying the new model?
The former, according to its own reports, has been achieved in three ways. By using 100 per cent clean electricity in its manufacturing processes, prioritising transportation by sea and other means instead of by air, and increasing the amount of recycled and sustainable materials in its devices.

Apple says it will also stop using leather in its bands and cases, due to the high environmental cost of the livestock industry.

The remaining emissions are offset with carbon credits in environmental projects which, the company says, meet international standards to be real and quantifiable.

""Carbon credits applied are retired after the end of each fiscal year, to correspond to the remaining emissions from the total number of products sold in the prior fiscal year,"" Apple explains.

Is Apple's green strategy really sustainable?
Although the tech company has been bragging for years about being environmentally conscious in its products, some detractors see these ads as yet another greenwashing operation.

The very concept of 'carbon-neutral' has been called into question because of the confusion it creates for some consumers.

""There is no such thing as a carbon-neutral product,"" David Ho, climate scientist and professor at the University of Hawaii, told Wired magazine.

""It’s kind of silly. It gives consumers the idea that there are ways out of these problems that don’t involve consuming less,"" Ho considers.

The expert jokes on Twitter that unless the new Apple Watch absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere, the 'carbon-neutral' label is nothing more than marketing.


One of the main criticisms of 'carbon-neutral' products and services is that, while they can reduce the environmental impact of their production phase, they still rely on carbon credits, externalising emissions through investments in green projects such as reforestation.

This strategy has been questioned by environmental organisations such as the NewClimate Institute.

“Recent scientific literature has demonstrated again and again that the real impacts associated with carbon crediting projects is far inferior to what their labels suggest,” the non-profit organisation says.

“Due to natural or human-induced disturbances such as forest fires, land degradation or land-use change, carbon storage in forestry and land-use projects is likely to only be temporary, and therefore in no way comparable with not having emitted greenhouse gases in the first place.”

Is it better to reuse rather than recycle?
Given that the best way to reduce emissions is not to emit them in the first place, increasing the lifespan of our devices remains the best way to reduce their environmental footprint.

A 2019 study by the European Environmental Bureau noted that increasing the lifespan of our phones and other devices by just one year would reduce carbon emissions in the EU by as much as removing 2 million cars from our roads.

According to the network of environmental citizens’ organisations, some 211 million phones are sold each year in the EU. On average, they are used for just three years before being replaced by new models.

So even if tech companies increase their environmental commitments, extending the use of our devices is still the most sustainable option.

Don't Fall For Apple's Greenwashing
Carbon-neutral, my ass.

WILL LOCKETT
14 SEPT 2023

Photo by Daniel Cañibano on Unsplash
A few days ago, Apple did yet another one of its swanky launch events. The main focus of this one was the upcoming iPhone 15 and its EU-compliant USB-C port (RIP lightning port). But hidden among the pomp and excitement was something truly worrying: Apple’s next Apple Watch. The product itself is absolutely fine, if a bit expensive. But the problem has nothing to do with the watch itself; instead, it lies in Apple’s carbon-neutral claims about the watch. You see, Tim Cook and the gang have engaged in some genuinely moronic greenwashing. Let me explain.

Let’s start off by acknowledging that Apple’s sustainability efforts have actually been okay. Their products have a longer operational life than most of their competitors. I use a 4-year-old iPhone, which runs great and uses the latest operating system; I couldn’t say the same if I used an Android. The same can be said for their iPads, computers and watches. This long life means Apple contributes less to e-waste, has a small manufacturing carbon footprint, and a smaller mining footprint (at least in theory). Apple also has a decent recycling scheme, although it isn’t as widespread and available as it should be.

** Quick interruption, if you want more from me, or interact with me, go follow me on Bluesky**

But the big feather in Apple’s sustainability cap is their carbon emissions and profit. Their annual emissions peaked in 2015 when they emitted 38.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. That year, Apple made a whopping 53.39 billion dollars in profit! 7 years later (2022), they emitted 46.35% less emissions at 20.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, yet their annual profits have soared to a staggering 99.8 billion dollars! This means Apple has successfully and dramatically decoupled growth from emissions, a critical step towards sustainability.

These are all steps in the right direction. But Apple is still miles away from true sustainability.

So, when Apple announced they were creating carbon-neutral products, my curiosity peaked. How have they made such a giant leap forward? Well, they hadn’t.

In the announcement, they stated that specific case and band combinations of the Apple Watch Series 9, Ultra 2 and SE will be entirely carbon-neutral and labelled and advertised as such. They went on to say they had done this by reducing emissions from materials, electricity, and transportation in the production of the watches. One of the main ways they have done this is to pressurise their supply chain to use renewable energy — though I have yet to find out if this is genuine renewable energy or renewable energy credits. Any remaining pollution will be offset through nature-based projects like restoring forests and increasing their carbon capacity. Furthermore, Apple will also offset the electricity the consumer will use to charge the device by buying carbon credits that fund renewable energy infrastructure.

All sounds good, right? Well, it turns out the carbon offsetting Apple is doing here is more than a little dubious.

Let’s start with the odd one: renewable energy infrastructure carbon credits. On the surface, these seem like an innocuous and obvious way to reduce and offset emissions, but they aren’t. They don’t pull carbon out of the atmosphere; they merely reduce the carbon that will enter the atmosphere in the future, and not by all that much. This is why this offsetting approach can’t be used to reach net-zero. Furthermore, renewable energy isn’t a charitable cause that needs funding like this. It is a vastly profitable industry that fossil fuel energy companies need to transition into by spending their hundreds of billions of dollars of expansion money on, rather than investing in yet more oil fields. So, in a roundabout way, renewable energy infrastructure carbon credits are allowing fossil fuel companies to continue expanding their planet-wrecking ways rather than transitioning as they should. All of this is why experts say this type of carbon credit is utter junk and means nothing.

Now let’s look at the other offsetting method, Natural carbon credits. These pay to restore and expand natural carbon-rich environments like rainforests or mangroves to pull carbon out of the atmosphere. In theory, they work and do good, but they are incredibly dubious for carbon-neutral claims. You see, calculating how much carbon is stored is incredibly difficult and susceptible to cherry-picking, meaning the carbon credits linked to these practices are not verifiable or reliable. What’s more, these ecosystems don’t have the capacity to store enough carbon to truly help us reach net-zero. These natural carbon sinks are also vulnerable to collapse and carbon release from things like wildfires and even earthquakes, so they aren’t a safe form of carbon storage either.

So, claiming a product or service is carbon-neutral due to natural-derived carbon credits is incredibly inaccurate and misleading.

For example, a study looked into 40 large corporations that claimed to have carbon-neutral services or products thanks to natural carbon credits to see what their actual carbon footprint was. Unsurprisingly, they found that they had only reduced their emissions by 36%, and their carbon credits’ value (the total carbon captured) was wildly inaccurate.

This is why bodies like the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMI), which ensures organisations who join them report carbon correctly, have stated that Carbon credits like this cannot be used for offsetting emissions instead of reducing emissions within corporate value chains or for making ‘carbon-neutral’ claims. Basically, Offsetting like this is not a substitute for decarbonisation.

The law is even catching up with this scientific viewpoint. In the UK, it will soon be illegal to claim and advertise a product as carbon-neutral through offsets unless the company can prove and verify its credibility. This means that in the UK, Apple can’t sell the Apple Watch as carbon-neutral, as you can’t verify natural carbon credits.

But there are carbon offsetting methods you can verify, such as Climeworks Direct Air Capture (DAC) systems. Third parties have verified them, so when you pay to offset one tonne of carbon dioxide, that is how much is pulled from the air. So why doesn’t Apple just use this type of offsetting?

Well, DAC technology is far more expensive than natural carbon credits, pricing it out of even Apple’s reach. What’s more, the annual capacity of DAC technology is tiny, at only 10,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. So even if Apple scooped up every single DAC-derived carbon credit out there (most of which isn’t verified like Climeworks), then they can only offset 0.05% of their emissions. In other words, there probably aren’t enough DAC carbon credits in the world for Apple to make the Apple Watch verifiably carbon-neutral.

It’s a damn shame that a company like Apple feels the need to sully its already decent (but not good enough) sustainability record with such transparent greenwashing. There are so many better ways to show your efforts towards sustainability than undermining your own credibility like this. For example, if they joined the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative, the massive efforts they have put into reducing the actual emissions from products like the Apple Watch can be better highlighted and marketed with integrity and honesty. Surely, that is a better way of going forward, rather than trying to dupe consumers?

Will.

No single company can produce a product without any emission or discharge.

We are very dependent on fossil fuels and will be for decades to come. Whether in sourcing synthetics for everything, using it to mine for minerals, or for travel.

Rather than fret over the release of CO2 we should adapt to the changing physical world.

",
telekom,"Telecommunications and other technology companies like Vodafone, Google and TDC can impact the environment. It’s no secret that telecom infrastructure and data centers consume significant energy. At the same time, telecommunications reduces energy consumption in that people work from home instead of driving to the office. While one of the world’s smallest countries in population and land mass, Denmark is a leading green energy provider with solar and wind power. It leads in the innovation in energy sources and well as market instruments to facilitate green energy purchase. In this research note, Strand Consult reviews these exciting developments by Google and TDC in Denmark, but cautions against the hype or the recent greenwashing by Vodafone, the deceptive marketing that an organization is environmentally friendly. A key challenge is the electric grid itself, which is essentially one big pool of energy mixed from renewable and non-renewable sources, making it difficult, if not impossible for consumers to ensure that their selected set of energy is from renewable sources.

The green energy industry is facing a paradigm shift. Many green energy providers can compete without subsidies against traditional fossil fuels.  Climate is a growing public policy concern, and the telecom industry will play an increasing role to support green, sustainable energy solutions. They can do this either by purchasing Guarantees of Origin (GOs) from their energy providers or by entering into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with companies that produce green energy.

The PPA is a contract between two parties; one that generates electricity (the seller) and one that purchases electricity (the buyer). These contracts can be so large and significant that a green energy provider may build a specific green energy plant for a single client or small group of clients which buy all or most of the energy produced. Locking in supply, price, and sustainable terms is the goal of many leading executive officers with responsibility for finance, procurement, sustainability, and so on.

Case: Vodafone The King of greenwashing.

Last week, Vodafone announced that 100 percent of its European networks will be powered from renewable sources from 1 July 2021 and that their red corporate logo will be turned green to mark the shift. This kind of gimmick is tailor-made for the press, heavy on style but light on substance. Vodafone is using mainly Guarantees of Origin (GOs) to achieve its green targets.

Only a small portion of the green power that Vodafone buys is green. In practical terms, Vodafone Direct Power has agreements (PPAs) in the United Kingdom and in Spain Vodafone use both PPAs and GOs. Vodafone has a total of just over 31 million customers in the two countries. In Albania, 67% of electricity is from local renewable sources. Vodafone has just over 1.4 million customers in Albania.

Most of Vodafone’s power is consumed in countries where Vodafone uses GOs to claim they are green: Italy, Germany, Ireland, Hungary, Romania, Greece, Turkey and the Czech Republic. Vodafone has 108 million customers in these countries. In practical terms, Vodafone’s GOs do not produce more green energy.

Decarbonizing the energy system

Decarbonization includes a set of goals such as substitution of low/no emission power sources; improved energy efficiency; improved grid flexibility and storage; and the use of carbon capture from fossil fuels. PPAs represent the second phase of decarbonization in which the market, not the government, takes the lead in driving solutions. Corporations of their own accord chose their energy systems and build the end-to-end supply chain, notably the selection of the energy source, its distribution to the firm, and its consumption within the firm. PPAs play an important role to increase not only the percentage of renewable energy on the grid but ensuring the transparency of its neutral tax treatment compared to other sources. No virtue-signaling telco strategy would measure up these days without a salute to the environment and promise to be as green as a tree-dwelling pygmy. Scientists have been quick to blame a European summer of storms and devastating floods on climate change, caused by people who prefer air-conditioned flats and Netflix to the hunter-gatherer lifestyle.

Even Alok Sharma, a smug-faced member of the UK government, has recently joined in the condemnation, despite jetting off to 30 countries in a seven-month period. Ordinary folk would not get away with this virus-spreading, planet-killing behavior during the worst pandemic since 1918, but the elite seem to be exempt from the rules. If the world were full of Alok Sharmas, Londoners might already be commuting to work by rowboat.


Figure 1:Telcos don't want blaming for their disappearance.Telcos don't want blaming for their disappearance.

Point is, as energy-guzzling corporations fall under public scrutiny, telcos are desperate to absolve themselves of responsibility for homeless polar bears and slushy icecaps. The industry is even promoting itself as an environmental savior. The mobile telecom sector accounts for just 0.4% of global carbon emissions and ""enables"" carbon reduction in other industries that are ""ten times that level,"" said Mats Granryd, the director general of the GSM Association, shortly after boosting his carbon footprint on a kerosene-powered flight to Barcelona so that he would not have to bother with Zoom.

Nearly all the European incumbents now dedicate pages of their annual reports to backslapping about their environmental friendliness. These are usually sprinkled liberally with expressions like ""carbon-neutral"" and ""net zero"" and make a big deal of renewables as a source of energy. Aside from a few dates and details, they all look the same.

Carbon clampdown

Take BT and Vodafone, two of the UK's largest network operators, for instance. BT has pledged to be a ""net zero business"" by 2045 and claims since November last year to have sourced all its electricity from renewables. Vodafone has been doing the same since July and aims to be net zero by 2030. Other big operators have similar targets. France's Orange and Germany's Deutsche Telekom reckon the carbon clampdown will be complete by 2040.

Why does Vodafone, with its international business, think it can beat the mainly British BT to this net-zero gong by 15 years? Even if Vodafone were a green pioneer, and BT a laggard, you would expect a difference of just a year or two. Yet BT claims to have hit the 100% renewables milestone eight months ahead of Vodafone. A 15-year gap adds to the impression these are just arbitrary dates whisked out of the carbon-filled air.

The definition of net zero, moreover, is as hazy as the sky above a coal-fired power plant. Philippe Tuzolino, Orange's environmental director, fesses up in a detailed blog that net zero is not the same as carbon neutrality, which ""can only be considered on a global scale."" Individual companies have no or limited control over what others might do. What's more, the whole concept of carbon neutrality is misleading, judging by Tuzolino's blog. ""In reality, a company can only contribute to global carbon neutrality and cannot be neutral in itself because it continues to operate as a business and therefore emit CO2,"" he writes.

The reason Orange thinks being net zero will take another 19 years is that it factors in what its suppliers and customers will do under so-called ""Scope 3"" emissions. Vodafone uses the same terminology and – its annual report small print shows – has the same 2040 target when Scope 3 is considered.

Want to know more about 5G? Check out our dedicated 5G content channel here on Light Reading. Operators can exert a great deal of influence by refusing to buy stuff from careless suppliers. But there is limit to how virtuous they can be. Smartphones, of which about 1.5 billion are sold annually, use raw materials such as tantalum that must be dug out of the ground, often in parts of the world with unsavory regimes. Mining and production alone are thought to account for most of a gadget's carbon footprint over its lifetime. The environmental cost of smartphone use might be relatively small. Granryd reckons using a smartphone for a year has the same impact as driving a car for three hours or flipping eight hamburgers. But take-up and usage are rocketing, and operators cannot dictate the terms of energy consumption to their subscribers. Even as they proselytize about carbon reduction, operators are urging industries to connect more objects to electricity-using telecom networks. A future Internet of Things will feature billions of those objects, they hope. In late 2017, Anders Andrae, a researcher at China's Huawei, reckoned the entire information and communications technology sector would consume a fifth of the world's electricity and be responsible for 5.5% of its carbon emissions by 2025. No guarantees The renewables schemes that operators tout in their annual reports also provoke skepticism. They rely heavily on the ""guarantees of origin"" that companies are now able to purchase from energy providers. But these certificates are extremely controversial. They can be traded, rather like financial assets, and do not always have the desired effect. ""The traded market prices are so low that the money is not enough to finance new green energy,"" said Strand Consult, a Danish advisory group, in recently published research. ""Certificates can change hands without causing any new renewable energy to be added or produced – a green transaction, but no transition."" Such concerns prompted the UK government to launch its own investigation this month. Its REGO (renewable energy guarantees of origin) system is open to abuse, reports the Guardian newspaper, because of various loopholes. One risk is of ""double counting"" renewable energy supply use, says the Guardian report, while another is that foreign renewables are claimed as the UK's own. None of this means operators should abandon their green commitments. But the achievements and targets they cite hold little value without context, transparency and a recognition that environmental schemes have shortcomings. How, for instance, do operators reconcile their current enthusiasm for open RAN, a technology that relies on more power-hungry chips, with a pledge to be more energy-efficient? Few seriously believe that corporations and their dividend-hungry shareholders care more about coral reefs than cash flow. But energy efficiency could boost profitability and prevent operators from losing environmentally aware customers. A focus on those business benefits would be a good place for the industry to start.

Along with their commitment to green energy, companies also require transparency to energy source and policy. For example, much of the electricity that powers electric cars comes from coal, undermining the goal of decarbonizing the energy system. Moreover, many alternative energy sources are subsidized, obscuring the true cost to the consumer and delaying a legitimate competitive market for energy. A bona fide PPA should offer certification of the legitimate, sustainable source of the energy as well its forthright tax treatment. 

Telecom companies are accustomed to operating under transparency obligations; consumers select their telecom provider in part based on traffic management disclosures. Telecom companies can leverage this expertise in transparency to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability. Through their purchasing power of green energy, they will help drive the decarbonization of the energy system.

Certificates: green transition or green transaction?

Telecom operators can also purchase Guarantees of Origin (GOs) directly associated with the new power plants. When telecom operators buy electricity and GO certificates directly from green energy producers, they can ensure that they are helping to displace fossil fuels with renewable energy – a green transition. For example, Better Energy’s PPAs and certificates of origin are site-specific which represents solar energy directly traced to new solar plants, not green energy commingled with energy from carbon-based sources, When purchasing mixed energy from the grid, many are under the illusion that they are addressing climate change when they are not. They are shuffling, not switching. The certificate system of GOs divides green power sold by a power producer into two separate products: electricity and environmental attributes (benefits). The physical electricity is sold as KWh, and the green attributes are sold as certificates.

Certificates can be traded and re-traded electronically on the global market, like financial assets. A company pays a broker, and brokers pass some of the money the company that generated the green energy. In theory, this money should help get new energy built. However, the traded market prices are so low that the money is not enough to finance new green energy. Moreover, certificates can be from older power plants. Certificates can change hands without causing any new renewable energy to be added or produced – a green transaction, but no transition.

Telecom operators may have the best intentions when they purchase certificates, but their impact will be limited to none unless they do the due diligence. They likely need to set up a PPA.

Case: Google and Better Energy in Denmark.

Last year Better Energy A/S in Denmark, a leader in the field of sustainable energy engineering, developed a PPA with Google to power a data center in Denmark powered by with five solar plants.

The policy prerequisites for these deals are modernized energy legislation and neutral tax treatment. It also requires that the country has a well-developed grid infrastructure to enable power transmission from the source to the end user. Telecommunications companies consume energy across networks around world day in and out, and they can benefit significantly from these energy market instruments such as PPAs.

Better Energy is partnering with leading technology firms to provide subsidy-free, certified green energy.  In addition to Google, it inked some 300 megawatts (MW) worth of deals in 2019 with bioscience firm Christian Hansen, the retailer Bestseller, and other high-profile companies for which sustainability is important to shareholders, customers, and employers. Megawatts measure the output of a power plant or the amount of electricity required by an entire city. One megawatt (MW)=1,000 kilowatts or 1,000,000 watts. A typical coal plant has the capacity of 600 MW. The PPA signed with Google for solar energy from Better Energy’s plants is not only green, it’s the first subsidy-free green energy project in Denmark. Better Energy has plans to add 7 GW (gigawatt=1 billion watts) or the equivalent of 22 million solar panels within the coming 6-8 years.

The PPA is an important economic and financial vehicle to support decarbonizing the energy supply, building demand for green energy sources, and securing capacity and sustainability on the electric grid. Policymakers should recognize this tool and ensure that corporations have the freedom to use it to realize climate goals. 

Case: TDC and Better Energy in Denmark.

This week, TDC A/S and Better Energy  A/S announced a PPA  agreement in which Better Energy builds four solar farms that in two years will supply 60 percent of all the power for TDC’s infrastructure company, TDC Net.

TDC Net owns and operates three national mobile, fixed and cable networks. The four new solar farms will be built in Svendborg and Nørre Aaby on the island of Fyn as well as two locations in Jutland. The new solar parks will begin delivering green power from early 2022.

This means that TDC’s power consumption, like the power consumption of other telecommunications companies, is expected to grow by 2.5% by 2028 due to increasing expansion of infrastructure as well as the growing data consumption, which is increasing by about 40 percent per year in Denmark.

The goal for TDC is that they use 100% real green power by 2028, and TDC is now aiming to be able to enter into similar agreements to get green power from wind turbines. The goal is that by 2023 the TDC infrastructure company has reduced its CO2 emissions by 50 percent and that by 2028 it should be reduced to zero.

What is happening in Denmark is that the largest telecommunications company takes social responsibility together with one of the largest providers of green energy and supports the ambitious national plan to make Denmark independent of fossil fuels.

Double jeopardy for taxpayers – Facts about greenwashing

Certificate trading in this secondary market also puts citizens at risk for paying twice for the same green energy. When renewable energy projects are subsidized by the government, the money comes from taxpaying citizens. If companies purchase certificates from these subsidized projects and then turn around and charge consumers extra for the “green” products they produce with this energy, the same citizens pay twice. The subsidies/citizens are the reason that new renewable energy gets built and added to the grid, not the companies.

The complex certificate market can be misleading and needs overhaul. The challenge with green certificates is that they don’t all represent carbon reductions, and they don’t all drive change or represent new green energy. There is no way for buyers to tell the difference. Most renewable energy certificates traded on the market are produced by older or existing power plants, for example, hydropower stations in Norway or older generation wind turbines that are already running profitably.

If an older power source is in operation, the owners or brokers will certainly be happy to get money from the green certificates, but it won’t lead to more green power. The buyer won’t add anything to the grid that hasn’t already been there. The buyer is thus trading marketing rights, not changing the grid. It a donation – not a net new impact. 

Location, location, location

It is important to understand that shopping in other geographic locations or across market zones does not save money or reduce emissions in the local energy mix. If the buyer’s PPA trading points and the project’s actual delivery points are in different markets (or in a market with zonal pricings), and the PPA payments are based on the price in the project’s market, the buyer is exposed to basis or locational risk. Even more experienced buyers do not realize that in markets with zonal pricings, there is locational risk.

Signing PPAs for projects in other countries does not make the local energy mix any greener. It was critical to the Google agreement in Denmark, for example, that the new power plants be built in the same geographic grid area as Google’s new Danish data center.

The electricity that flows through the local power lines is determined by which power plants are currently producing electricity on the grid. If national power plants cannot produce enough electricity to match demand, electricity gets imported. In the case of Denmark, a lack of solar power at certain times means that the country must import electricity. Thus, the source of electricity is determined by location and time of consumption. 

Strand Consult´s research shows that large energy consumers like telecom operators and data centers are physically connected to a local grid, so the carbon footprint of their operations depends on the current mix of renewable and non-renewable energy that is flowing through the local lines. If companies are physically located in Denmark, and they sign PPA contracts or purchase certificates from Norway, this doesn’t change their local energy mix. The physical energy they consume has not changed. The only way a telecom operator can lower the carbon emissions of its operations is to improve efficiency, generate energy on site, or add more green energy to the local grid. Virtual trading does not change physical reality.

New phase in the green transition

Telecom operators can be leaders in sustainability practice, provided the right policy framework. Telecom operators are hungry for ways to become fully renewable in the energy they use and hungry to deliver climate action with measurable results. These companies can have great impact in transforming our energy system with the right green energy products and the right policy framework. Denmark is one ambitious country using climate policy for competitive advantage and geopolitics.

For more than 25 years, Strand Consult has held strategic workshops for boards of directors and other leaders in the telecom industry. Its workshop Next gen telecom policy and regulation: Workshop for leaders in the telecommunications industry offers knowledge on global regulatory trends and the experience of operators worldwide and is packaged it into a workshop for professionals with responsibility for policy, public affairs, regulation, communications, strategy and related roles.

Our ESG Strategy
The five ESG focus areas
 
At Nokia we believe that there is no green without digital. We believe that ESG is a driver of value creation and new revenue streams. Our ambition as first movers is to create new competitive opportunities while creating tangible environmental and social benefits. We have built on five strategic focus areas in our ESG strategy:

Environment (climate & circularity)
Industrial digitalization
Security & Privacy
Bridging the digital divide
Responsible business
In the environment arena, we focus on two areas: climate and circularity. Our greatest source of emissions comes from the use of our products in our customers’ networks. To address this, we aim for leadership in energy efficiency, building on work in silicon, software, and systems and opportunities to optimize across the network with energy orchestration and green operations. In circularity we focus on opportunities to promote hardware circularity and manage the sourcing and reuse of key source materials.


Our handprint and footprint
We believe the technology we provide enables both environmental and social benefits to individuals, industries and communities that far outweigh any negative impacts. These benefits represent the handprint of digitalization and connectivity. We have both a social and an environmental handprint. We work hard to maximize this handprint. At the same time, we know we must continually strive to minimize any potential negative impacts of technology. This is our footprint. We work to make our footprint on the world around us as small as possible. We collaborate throughout our value chain to continually minimize our footprint.

These two aspects of our approach are underpinned by responsible and ethical business practices. We strive to be a trusted, ethical company that our employees, customers, partners and investors are proud to work for and with. As part of our responsible approach, we aim for: 

 

Robust practices, procedures and policies that minimize risk
Management accountability for ESG and responsibility throughout the organization
Trust, accountability, & ethical behavior as foundations on which we operate
Certified and audited management systems
A robust people strategy and mature processes to attract, retain and develop talent

Modern slavery statement","Telecommunications and other technology companies like Vodafone, Google and TDC can impact the environment. It’s no secret that telecom infrastructure and data centers consume significant energy. At the same time, telecommunications reduces energy consumption in that people work from home instead of driving to the office. While one of the world’s smallest countries in population and land mass, Denmark is a leading green energy provider with solar and wind power. It leads in the innovation in energy sources and well as market instruments to facilitate green energy purchase. In this research note, Strand Consult reviews these exciting developments by Google and TDC in Denmark, but cautions against the hype or the recent greenwashing by Vodafone, the deceptive marketing that an organization is environmentally friendly. A key challenge is the electric grid itself, which is essentially one big pool of energy mixed from renewable and non-renewable sources, making it difficult, if not impossible for consumers to ensure that their selected set of energy is from renewable sources.

The green energy industry is facing a paradigm shift. Many green energy providers can compete without subsidies against traditional fossil fuels.  Climate is a growing public policy concern, and the telecom industry will play an increasing role to support green, sustainable energy solutions. They can do this either by purchasing Guarantees of Origin (GOs) from their energy providers or by entering into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with companies that produce green energy.

The PPA is a contract between two parties; one that generates electricity (the seller) and one that purchases electricity (the buyer). These contracts can be so large and significant that a green energy provider may build a specific green energy plant for a single client or small group of clients which buy all or most of the energy produced. Locking in supply, price, and sustainable terms is the goal of many leading executive officers with responsibility for finance, procurement, sustainability, and so on.

Case: Vodafone The King of greenwashing.

Last week, Vodafone announced that 100 percent of its European networks will be powered from renewable sources from 1 July 2021 and that their red corporate logo will be turned green to mark the shift. This kind of gimmick is tailor-made for the press, heavy on style but light on substance. Vodafone is using mainly Guarantees of Origin (GOs) to achieve its green targets.

Only a small portion of the green power that Vodafone buys is green. In practical terms, Vodafone Direct Power has agreements (PPAs) in the United Kingdom and in Spain Vodafone use both PPAs and GOs. Vodafone has a total of just over 31 million customers in the two countries. In Albania, 67% of electricity is from local renewable sources. Vodafone has just over 1.4 million customers in Albania.

Most of Vodafone’s power is consumed in countries where Vodafone uses GOs to claim they are green: Italy, Germany, Ireland, Hungary, Romania, Greece, Turkey and the Czech Republic. Vodafone has 108 million customers in these countries. In practical terms, Vodafone’s GOs do not produce more green energy.

Decarbonizing the energy system

Decarbonization includes a set of goals such as substitution of low/no emission power sources; improved energy efficiency; improved grid flexibility and storage; and the use of carbon capture from fossil fuels. PPAs represent the second phase of decarbonization in which the market, not the government, takes the lead in driving solutions. Corporations of their own accord chose their energy systems and build the end-to-end supply chain, notably the selection of the energy source, its distribution to the firm, and its consumption within the firm. PPAs play an important role to increase not only the percentage of renewable energy on the grid but ensuring the transparency of its neutral tax treatment compared to other sources. No virtue-signaling telco strategy would measure up these days without a salute to the environment and promise to be as green as a tree-dwelling pygmy. Scientists have been quick to blame a European summer of storms and devastating floods on climate change, caused by people who prefer air-conditioned flats and Netflix to the hunter-gatherer lifestyle.

Even Alok Sharma, a smug-faced member of the UK government, has recently joined in the condemnation, despite jetting off to 30 countries in a seven-month period. Ordinary folk would not get away with this virus-spreading, planet-killing behavior during the worst pandemic since 1918, but the elite seem to be exempt from the rules. If the world were full of Alok Sharmas, Londoners might already be commuting to work by rowboat.


Figure 1:Telcos don't want blaming for their disappearance.Telcos don't want blaming for their disappearance.

Point is, as energy-guzzling corporations fall under public scrutiny, telcos are desperate to absolve themselves of responsibility for homeless polar bears and slushy icecaps. The industry is even promoting itself as an environmental savior. The mobile telecom sector accounts for just 0.4% of global carbon emissions and ""enables"" carbon reduction in other industries that are ""ten times that level,"" said Mats Granryd, the director general of the GSM Association, shortly after boosting his carbon footprint on a kerosene-powered flight to Barcelona so that he would not have to bother with Zoom.

Nearly all the European incumbents now dedicate pages of their annual reports to backslapping about their environmental friendliness. These are usually sprinkled liberally with expressions like ""carbon-neutral"" and ""net zero"" and make a big deal of renewables as a source of energy. Aside from a few dates and details, they all look the same.

Carbon clampdown

Take BT and Vodafone, two of the UK's largest network operators, for instance. BT has pledged to be a ""net zero business"" by 2045 and claims since November last year to have sourced all its electricity from renewables. Vodafone has been doing the same since July and aims to be net zero by 2030. Other big operators have similar targets. France's Orange and Germany's Deutsche Telekom reckon the carbon clampdown will be complete by 2040.

Why does Vodafone, with its international business, think it can beat the mainly British BT to this net-zero gong by 15 years? Even if Vodafone were a green pioneer, and BT a laggard, you would expect a difference of just a year or two. Yet BT claims to have hit the 100% renewables milestone eight months ahead of Vodafone. A 15-year gap adds to the impression these are just arbitrary dates whisked out of the carbon-filled air.

The definition of net zero, moreover, is as hazy as the sky above a coal-fired power plant. Philippe Tuzolino, Orange's environmental director, fesses up in a detailed blog that net zero is not the same as carbon neutrality, which ""can only be considered on a global scale."" Individual companies have no or limited control over what others might do. What's more, the whole concept of carbon neutrality is misleading, judging by Tuzolino's blog. ""In reality, a company can only contribute to global carbon neutrality and cannot be neutral in itself because it continues to operate as a business and therefore emit CO2,"" he writes.

The reason Orange thinks being net zero will take another 19 years is that it factors in what its suppliers and customers will do under so-called ""Scope 3"" emissions. Vodafone uses the same terminology and – its annual report small print shows – has the same 2040 target when Scope 3 is considered.

Want to know more about 5G? Check out our dedicated 5G content channel here on Light Reading. Operators can exert a great deal of influence by refusing to buy stuff from careless suppliers. But there is limit to how virtuous they can be. Smartphones, of which about 1.5 billion are sold annually, use raw materials such as tantalum that must be dug out of the ground, often in parts of the world with unsavory regimes. Mining and production alone are thought to account for most of a gadget's carbon footprint over its lifetime. The environmental cost of smartphone use might be relatively small. Granryd reckons using a smartphone for a year has the same impact as driving a car for three hours or flipping eight hamburgers. But take-up and usage are rocketing, and operators cannot dictate the terms of energy consumption to their subscribers. Even as they proselytize about carbon reduction, operators are urging industries to connect more objects to electricity-using telecom networks. A future Internet of Things will feature billions of those objects, they hope. In late 2017, Anders Andrae, a researcher at China's Huawei, reckoned the entire information and communications technology sector would consume a fifth of the world's electricity and be responsible for 5.5% of its carbon emissions by 2025. No guarantees The renewables schemes that operators tout in their annual reports also provoke skepticism. They rely heavily on the ""guarantees of origin"" that companies are now able to purchase from energy providers. But these certificates are extremely controversial. They can be traded, rather like financial assets, and do not always have the desired effect. ""The traded market prices are so low that the money is not enough to finance new green energy,"" said Strand Consult, a Danish advisory group, in recently published research. ""Certificates can change hands without causing any new renewable energy to be added or produced – a green transaction, but no transition."" Such concerns prompted the UK government to launch its own investigation this month. Its REGO (renewable energy guarantees of origin) system is open to abuse, reports the Guardian newspaper, because of various loopholes. One risk is of ""double counting"" renewable energy supply use, says the Guardian report, while another is that foreign renewables are claimed as the UK's own. None of this means operators should abandon their green commitments. But the achievements and targets they cite hold little value without context, transparency and a recognition that environmental schemes have shortcomings. How, for instance, do operators reconcile their current enthusiasm for open RAN, a technology that relies on more power-hungry chips, with a pledge to be more energy-efficient? Few seriously believe that corporations and their dividend-hungry shareholders care more about coral reefs than cash flow. But energy efficiency could boost profitability and prevent operators from losing environmentally aware customers. A focus on those business benefits would be a good place for the industry to start.

Along with their commitment to green energy, companies also require transparency to energy source and policy. For example, much of the electricity that powers electric cars comes from coal, undermining the goal of decarbonizing the energy system. Moreover, many alternative energy sources are subsidized, obscuring the true cost to the consumer and delaying a legitimate competitive market for energy. A bona fide PPA should offer certification of the legitimate, sustainable source of the energy as well its forthright tax treatment. 

Telecom companies are accustomed to operating under transparency obligations; consumers select their telecom provider in part based on traffic management disclosures. Telecom companies can leverage this expertise in transparency to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability. Through their purchasing power of green energy, they will help drive the decarbonization of the energy system.

Certificates: green transition or green transaction?

Telecom operators can also purchase Guarantees of Origin (GOs) directly associated with the new power plants. When telecom operators buy electricity and GO certificates directly from green energy producers, they can ensure that they are helping to displace fossil fuels with renewable energy – a green transition. For example, Better Energy’s PPAs and certificates of origin are site-specific which represents solar energy directly traced to new solar plants, not green energy commingled with energy from carbon-based sources, When purchasing mixed energy from the grid, many are under the illusion that they are addressing climate change when they are not. They are shuffling, not switching. The certificate system of GOs divides green power sold by a power producer into two separate products: electricity and environmental attributes (benefits). The physical electricity is sold as KWh, and the green attributes are sold as certificates.

Certificates can be traded and re-traded electronically on the global market, like financial assets. A company pays a broker, and brokers pass some of the money the company that generated the green energy. In theory, this money should help get new energy built. However, the traded market prices are so low that the money is not enough to finance new green energy. Moreover, certificates can be from older power plants. Certificates can change hands without causing any new renewable energy to be added or produced – a green transaction, but no transition.

Telecom operators may have the best intentions when they purchase certificates, but their impact will be limited to none unless they do the due diligence. They likely need to set up a PPA.

Case: Google and Better Energy in Denmark.

Last year Better Energy A/S in Denmark, a leader in the field of sustainable energy engineering, developed a PPA with Google to power a data center in Denmark powered by with five solar plants.

The policy prerequisites for these deals are modernized energy legislation and neutral tax treatment. It also requires that the country has a well-developed grid infrastructure to enable power transmission from the source to the end user. Telecommunications companies consume energy across networks around world day in and out, and they can benefit significantly from these energy market instruments such as PPAs.

Better Energy is partnering with leading technology firms to provide subsidy-free, certified green energy.  In addition to Google, it inked some 300 megawatts (MW) worth of deals in 2019 with bioscience firm Christian Hansen, the retailer Bestseller, and other high-profile companies for which sustainability is important to shareholders, customers, and employers. Megawatts measure the output of a power plant or the amount of electricity required by an entire city. One megawatt (MW)=1,000 kilowatts or 1,000,000 watts. A typical coal plant has the capacity of 600 MW. The PPA signed with Google for solar energy from Better Energy’s plants is not only green, it’s the first subsidy-free green energy project in Denmark. Better Energy has plans to add 7 GW (gigawatt=1 billion watts) or the equivalent of 22 million solar panels within the coming 6-8 years.

The PPA is an important economic and financial vehicle to support decarbonizing the energy supply, building demand for green energy sources, and securing capacity and sustainability on the electric grid. Policymakers should recognize this tool and ensure that corporations have the freedom to use it to realize climate goals. 

Case: TDC and Better Energy in Denmark.

This week, TDC A/S and Better Energy  A/S announced a PPA  agreement in which Better Energy builds four solar farms that in two years will supply 60 percent of all the power for TDC’s infrastructure company, TDC Net.

TDC Net owns and operates three national mobile, fixed and cable networks. The four new solar farms will be built in Svendborg and Nørre Aaby on the island of Fyn as well as two locations in Jutland. The new solar parks will begin delivering green power from early 2022.

This means that TDC’s power consumption, like the power consumption of other telecommunications companies, is expected to grow by 2.5% by 2028 due to increasing expansion of infrastructure as well as the growing data consumption, which is increasing by about 40 percent per year in Denmark.

The goal for TDC is that they use 100% real green power by 2028, and TDC is now aiming to be able to enter into similar agreements to get green power from wind turbines. The goal is that by 2023 the TDC infrastructure company has reduced its CO2 emissions by 50 percent and that by 2028 it should be reduced to zero.

What is happening in Denmark is that the largest telecommunications company takes social responsibility together with one of the largest providers of green energy and supports the ambitious national plan to make Denmark independent of fossil fuels.

Double jeopardy for taxpayers – Facts about greenwashing

Certificate trading in this secondary market also puts citizens at risk for paying twice for the same green energy. When renewable energy projects are subsidized by the government, the money comes from taxpaying citizens. If companies purchase certificates from these subsidized projects and then turn around and charge consumers extra for the “green” products they produce with this energy, the same citizens pay twice. The subsidies/citizens are the reason that new renewable energy gets built and added to the grid, not the companies.

The complex certificate market can be misleading and needs overhaul. The challenge with green certificates is that they don’t all represent carbon reductions, and they don’t all drive change or represent new green energy. There is no way for buyers to tell the difference. Most renewable energy certificates traded on the market are produced by older or existing power plants, for example, hydropower stations in Norway or older generation wind turbines that are already running profitably.

If an older power source is in operation, the owners or brokers will certainly be happy to get money from the green certificates, but it won’t lead to more green power. The buyer won’t add anything to the grid that hasn’t already been there. The buyer is thus trading marketing rights, not changing the grid. It a donation – not a net new impact. 

Location, location, location

It is important to understand that shopping in other geographic locations or across market zones does not save money or reduce emissions in the local energy mix. If the buyer’s PPA trading points and the project’s actual delivery points are in different markets (or in a market with zonal pricings), and the PPA payments are based on the price in the project’s market, the buyer is exposed to basis or locational risk. Even more experienced buyers do not realize that in markets with zonal pricings, there is locational risk.

Signing PPAs for projects in other countries does not make the local energy mix any greener. It was critical to the Google agreement in Denmark, for example, that the new power plants be built in the same geographic grid area as Google’s new Danish data center.

The electricity that flows through the local power lines is determined by which power plants are currently producing electricity on the grid. If national power plants cannot produce enough electricity to match demand, electricity gets imported. In the case of Denmark, a lack of solar power at certain times means that the country must import electricity. Thus, the source of electricity is determined by location and time of consumption. 

Strand Consult´s research shows that large energy consumers like telecom operators and data centers are physically connected to a local grid, so the carbon footprint of their operations depends on the current mix of renewable and non-renewable energy that is flowing through the local lines. If companies are physically located in Denmark, and they sign PPA contracts or purchase certificates from Norway, this doesn’t change their local energy mix. The physical energy they consume has not changed. The only way a telecom operator can lower the carbon emissions of its operations is to improve efficiency, generate energy on site, or add more green energy to the local grid. Virtual trading does not change physical reality.

New phase in the green transition

Telecom operators can be leaders in sustainability practice, provided the right policy framework. Telecom operators are hungry for ways to become fully renewable in the energy they use and hungry to deliver climate action with measurable results. These companies can have great impact in transforming our energy system with the right green energy products and the right policy framework. Denmark is one ambitious country using climate policy for competitive advantage and geopolitics.

For more than 25 years, Strand Consult has held strategic workshops for boards of directors and other leaders in the telecom industry. Its workshop Next gen telecom policy and regulation: Workshop for leaders in the telecommunications industry offers knowledge on global regulatory trends and the experience of operators worldwide and is packaged it into a workshop for professionals with responsibility for policy, public affairs, regulation, communications, strategy and related roles.

Our ESG Strategy
The five ESG focus areas
 
At Nokia we believe that there is no green without digital. We believe that ESG is a driver of value creation and new revenue streams. Our ambition as first movers is to create new competitive opportunities while creating tangible environmental and social benefits. We have built on five strategic focus areas in our ESG strategy:

Environment (climate & circularity)
Industrial digitalization
Security & Privacy
Bridging the digital divide
Responsible business
In the environment arena, we focus on two areas: climate and circularity. Our greatest source of emissions comes from the use of our products in our customers’ networks. To address this, we aim for leadership in energy efficiency, building on work in silicon, software, and systems and opportunities to optimize across the network with energy orchestration and green operations. In circularity we focus on opportunities to promote hardware circularity and manage the sourcing and reuse of key source materials.


Our handprint and footprint
We believe the technology we provide enables both environmental and social benefits to individuals, industries and communities that far outweigh any negative impacts. These benefits represent the handprint of digitalization and connectivity. We have both a social and an environmental handprint. We work hard to maximize this handprint. At the same time, we know we must continually strive to minimize any potential negative impacts of technology. This is our footprint. We work to make our footprint on the world around us as small as possible. We collaborate throughout our value chain to continually minimize our footprint.

These two aspects of our approach are underpinned by responsible and ethical business practices. We strive to be a trusted, ethical company that our employees, customers, partners and investors are proud to work for and with. As part of our responsible approach, we aim for: 

 

Robust practices, procedures and policies that minimize risk
Management accountability for ESG and responsibility throughout the organization
Trust, accountability, & ethical behavior as foundations on which we operate
Certified and audited management systems
A robust people strategy and mature processes to attract, retain and develop talent

Materiality
As part of our strategy refresh and in line with good practice, we completed a materiality assessment in Spring 2022 with an external consultancy. The results of this assessment are based on desktop research, interviews and a survey conducted with internal and external stakeholder representatives (including employees, customers, investors, suppliers, partners, NGOs and academics), as well as insights from sustainability experts. The new materiality matrix was reviewed by the Group Leadership Team and the Board of Directors.

The diagram below shows the top right quadrant of our new materiality matrix. The magnified top right quadrant shows the topics that are all considered currently most relevant to our business and to stakeholders, the economy and the environment. The top 5 most material topics for Nokia are: 

Climate impact through products
Environmental impact through products and enabling transformation in other industries
Ethical business practices and ethical use of new technologies
Privacy and security
Responsible sourcing
Sources of input for the materiality work included:

Responsibilities and Operations of the CSD Committee
To build Huawei's competitiveness in sustainability, reduce
operating risks, and improve stakeholder satisfaction,
Huawei established a Corporate Sustainable Development
(CSD) Committee more than a decade ago. The Committee
guides business departments and the CSD sub-committees
in different business domains and regional offices as they
develop sustainability strategies and goals, and monitors
their implementation. The Committee consists of more than
10 senior executives from various departments, including
human resources (HR), manufacturing, logistics services,
procurement, and research and development (R&D).
Four committee members are board members. The CSD
Committee is chaired by Tao Jingwen, a board member and
President of the Quality, Business Process & IT Department.
The Committee meets each quarter and convenes special
meetings as necessary to discuss sustainability issues. The
major topics discussed at meetings in 2022 included energy
conservation and emissions reduction, renewable energy, the
circular economy, supplier management, digital inclusion, and
health and safety. To support the efficient operations of the
CSD Committee, we have appointed a working group, which
is responsible for coordinating and completing everyday
sustainability work and following up on the achievement of
strategic goals related to sustainability. The CSD Committee
has established monetary and non-monetary awards to
provide timely incentives to teams and individuals that have
displayed outstanding performance in sustainability. We have
also established the Sustainability Report Editorial Board, with
the chairman of the CSD Committee serving as the sponsor.
The Editorial Board is responsible for preparing, reviewing,
and releasing Huawei's sustainability reports.
The CSD Committee is supervised and guided by Huawei's
Board of Directors (BOD) and reports to the BOD as
necessary. Members of the BOD are elected by the
Representatives' Commission of Huawei and then voted in
by the Shareholders' Meeting. For details, see the ""Corporate
Governance Report"" section of the 2022 Annual Report of
Huawei Investment & Holding Co., Ltd.
Responsibilities of the CSD Committee
Facilitates sustainability-related communication with key stakeholders such as customers, regulators, and
industry organizations.
Drives the resolution of sustainability issues across domains or processes and coordinates sustainability
operations from end to end.
Coordinates the creation, implementation, and continuous improvement of the sustainability management
system; decides on sustainability related matters; and ensures that Huawei's sustainability management
complies with relevant laws and regulations, international standards, and customer requirements.
Provides guidance on the development, operation, and improvement of our environment, occupational health
and safety (EHS) management system, and handles major EHS issues.
Develops corporate-level sustainability strategies, guidelines, objectives, and policies; sets the course; and
monitors their implementation.
Sustainability Risks and Opportunities
To better identify and manage sustainability risks, Huawei has
created work instructions on managing sustainability risks.
These cover risk identification, risk assessment, target setting,
risk control, risk monitoring, and risk governance. Sustainability
risk management is ingrained in the company's business
processes and is not separated from business operations.
We believe that proactively identifying and managing
sustainability risks and opportunities can help enterprises
reduce operating risks and seize new business opportunities.
This will form a positive cycle that allows enterprises to grow
sustainably in our globalized world.

Risks and Opportunities Measures Sustainability
Strategy
The COVID-19 pandemic deepened the crisis in
education, causing severe disruptions in education
systems worldwide. School closures have had alarming
consequences on learning and well-being, particularly
for girls and the disadvantaged, including children with
disabilities, rural dwellers, and ethnic minorities. An
estimated 147 million children have missed more than
half of their in-person instruction over the past two years.
As part of our work to contribute to UN SDG 4 (Quality
Education), Huawei is working with partners, including
UNESCO and Close the Gap, to use innovative ICT
solutions to enable equal access to high-quality
education.
Digital Inclusion
Around 40,000 species are documented to be at risk of
extinction over the coming decades, 10 million hectares
of forest are being destroyed each year, and more than
half of key biodiversity areas remain unprotected.
Huawei is working closely with global environmental
protection organizations, customers, and partners on
projects that leverage ICT to protect forests, wetlands,
and oceans.
Digital Inclusion
According to World Health Organization (WHO), more
than one billion people in the world are affected by
some sort of disability, meaning that one in every seven
people has accessibility needs.
Huawei is providing more accessibility features, giving
users more confidence and freedom to enjoy the
convenience of smart devices.
Digital Inclusion
In 2005, the United Nations called upon organizations
around the world to improve financial inclusion and
ensure that responsible and sustainable financial
services are available for all, especially those in rural
and other impoverished areas, who are often neglected
by traditional financial services.
 Huawei Mobile Money helps bridge the digital divide
through mobile communications technologies and digital
payment platforms. This solution aims to give unbanked
people access to affordable and reliable
financial services.
Digital Inclusion
The world is growing more interconnected, digital, and
intelligent. As digital assets increase, attack surfaces are
continuing to expand, security vulnerabilities are being
exploited more frequently, and cyberspace as a whole
is becoming increasingly unsecure. These are making
cyber security assurance more important than ever.
Huawei has continued to make cyber security and
privacy protection a top priority. We confront cyber
security and privacy challenges and seizing related
opportunities through management transformation,
technological innovation, and open collaboration. We are
committed to fostering a better life for all in the future
digital world by offering secure and trustworthy products,
solutions, and services.
Security and
Trustworthiness
Cyber security and privacy protection are a shared
responsibility, and all stakeholders need to tackle this
global challenge together.
Adhering to our cyber security values of integrity,
trustworthiness, capability, accountability, openness, and
transparency, we welcome more communication and
collaboration with key stakeholders to jointly improve cyber
security capabilities. Together, we can promote standards
development, conduct joint innovation, and share
knowledge and best practices to improve cyber security.
Security and
Trustworthiness
Natural disasters and emergencies, such as floods,
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and conflicts, can
damage network infrastructure and affect people's
communication, work, and lives.
It is our mission and primary social responsibility to
maintain stable network operations. We have robust
mechanisms for responding to natural disasters
and emergencies and are continuing to improve
our capabilities in this regard. This has helped us to
support network stability for customers and stable
communications for users.
Security and
Trustworthiness
In today's highly globalized and specialized world,
Huawei's operations rely heavily on third parties,
including vendors, specialist agencies, and partners. This
makes business continuity management (BCM) critical.
Through years of sustained investment, Huawei has
established a BCM system for domains such as R&D,
procurement, manufacturing, logistics, and global technical
services. This system covers our end-to-end processes,
from suppliers to Huawei and to our customers.

Green and low-carbon development is now a global
priority. Stakeholders are increasingly expecting
enterprises to move towards green and low-carbon
development. Many regions, countries, and industry
organizations have released environmental regulations
and disclosure guidelines.
Huawei is proactively working to address climate and
environmental challenges. We use innovative ICT
solutions to protect our shared home by focusing on
three areas: advancing energy conservation and emissions
reduction, promoting renewable energy, and contributing
to a circular economy.
Environmental
Protection
As climate change becomes an increasingly pressing
issue, it is more important than ever to reduce
dependence on fossil fuels as a key to green
development.
At Huawei, we prioritize the use of renewable energy
in our own operations wherever possible. Our digital
power subsidiary also aims to drive an energy revolution
by focusing on clean power generation, mobility
electrification, and green ICT power infrastructure.
Environmental
Protection
Unsustainable patterns of consumption and production
are among the root causes of the triple planetary crises
of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution.
Changing our relationship with nature is key to a
sustainable future.
Huawei is committed to building a business model that
incorporates circular economy practices and a closed-loop
value chain. We are pursuing more eco-friendly materials,
more durable products, greener packaging, and less waste
throughout our product lifecycles so that all resources can
be efficiently used, reused, and recycled.
Environmental
Protection
Huawei operates in more than 170 countries and
regions. As such, hiring and nurturing local staff is an
important issue for our stakeholders.
Huawei has released the Resolutions on Strengthening
Localization Efforts, which states that localization is
part of Huawei's long-term strategy. According to the
Resolutions, Huawei should deploy as many local staff
as possible and help them fully unlock their potential,
require those engaging in global business to pass English
language certification, and provide better support and
services to local staff.
Healthy and
Harmonious
Ecosystem
With the imminent risk of an economic downturn,
many are expecting policies that spur production and
lift trade restrictions. Discriminatory policies will only
undermine free trade and global interests.
Huawei embraces free trade, open markets, and fair
competition. We will continue to support equitable and
non-discriminatory multilateral trade rules and place
trade compliance above our own commercial interests.
Healthy and
Harmonious
Ecosystem
As due diligence management is changing from
voluntary compliance to a mandatory obligation,
enterprises must find ways to avoid and address
adverse impacts on workers, human rights, and the
environment that may be associated with operations,
supply chains, and other business relationships.
Huawei has released the Global Procurement CSR Due
Diligence Regulation to guide procurement departments
at all levels to establish a risk-based, multi-layered
supplier CSR supervision process. This regulation will help
identify, prevent, mitigate, and explain the CSR risks that
Huawei's global supply chains face.
Healthy and
Harmonious
Ecosystem
In 2022, as countries around the world buckle down
for post-pandemic recovery, many have turned to
digitalization and the digital economy to address
socioeconomic challenges. Digital talent plays an
instrumental role in driving digital transformation and
unleashing digital productivity.
We are working hard to build digital skills in the countries
and regions where we operate. Back in 2008, Huawei
launched a program called Seeds for the Future to help
universities foster the next generation of digital talent.
Through this program, we are also helping upskill industry
and public sector professionals and nurture new tech
leadership, working with local communities to build basic
digital skills, and inspiring people to tackle real-world
challenges in tech competitions. To date, this program
has benefited more than 2.43 million people from over
150 countries.

The “Green Development 2030” is the latest in a series of “Intelligent World 2030” reports that systematically present Huawei's outlook on the future, and provide a general blueprint for the ICT industry's development and how it can contribute to other industries. 

“Green Development 2030” has been developed based on the industry insights and best practices Huawei has gathered over years, and supplemented by the input from nearly 100 industry experts and more than 30 third-party organizations including policy makers, associations, think tanks, and enterprises.

The “Green Development 2030” report focuses on how digitalization and decarbonization can drive green development, as well as potential applications of green ICT in key industries by 2030. 

It also explains the three main pathways that future ICT innovation should pursue to empower green development: 

Improving the energy efficiency of digital infrastructure.

Increasing the share of renewables in electricity generation.

Enabling green industries. 

This will provide insights for green development efforts worldwide.

Kevin Zhang, CMO of Huawei's ICT Infrastructure Business, said, ""Digitalization and decarbonization reinforce each other and jointly drive green development. ICT will be key to both digitalization and decarbonization processes. As a leader in ICT innovation, Huawei is committed to building green ICT infrastructure, accelerating the development of renewable energy, and improving energy savings and emission reductions in a wide range of industries. This is how we hope to promote sustainable development within our society at large.""

This service is aligned with the upcoming EU policy developments in relation to non-financial disclosure. The British parliament’s defence committee said on Thursday (9 October) that it had found clear evidence that telecoms giant Huawei had colluded with the Chinese state and said Britain may need to remove all Huawei equipment earlier than planned.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in July ordered Huawei equipment to be purged from the nascent 5G network by the end of 2027. U.S. President Donald Trump claimed credit for the British decision.

“The West must urgently unite to advance a counterweight to China’s tech dominance,” Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the defence committee, said. “We must not surrender our national security for the sake of short-term technological development.”

The committee did not go into detail about the exact nature of the ties but said it had seen clear evidence of Huawei collusion with “the Chinese Communist Party apparatus”.

Huawei said the report lacked credibility.

“It is built on opinion rather than fact. We’re sure people will see through these groundless accusations of collusion and remember instead what Huawei has delivered for Britain over the past 20 years,” a Huawei spokesman said.

When asked about the committee’s comments, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that some in the UK should think before they speak, and that the legitimate interests of Chinese companies were being damaged.

“The openness and fairness of the UK market, as well as the security of foreign investments there, is highly concerning,” she said, speaking at a daily news conference in Beijing on Friday.

Trump identifies China as the United States’ main geopolitical rival, and has accused the Communist Party-ruled state of taking advantage over trade and not telling the truth over the novel coronavirus outbreak, which he calls the “China plague”.

Washington and its allies say Huawei technology could be used to spy for China. Huawei has repeatedly denied this, and says the United States is simply jealous of its success.

British ministers say the rise to global dominance of Huawei, founded in 1987 by a former People’s Liberation Army engineer, has caught the West off guard.

The defence committee said it supported Johnson’s decision to eventually purge Huawei from Britain’s 5G network but noted that “developments could necessitate this date being moved forward, potentially to 2025” to be economically feasible. An influential US lawmaker said on Wednesday the Commerce Department should end all technology exports to Huawei and SMIC, China’s top manufacturer of semiconductors.

Republican Mike Gallagher – chair of the House of Representatives’ committee on China, which has pressed the Biden administration to take a tougher stance on US technology sent to China – urged harsher curbs after the discovery of new chips in Huawei phones that may violate trade restrictions.

The comments from Gallagher follow news that Chinese electronics giant Huawei started selling a phone last week called the Mate 60 Pro, which contains a chip that analysts believe was made after a breakthrough by Semiconductor International Manufacturing Corp (SMIC).

“This chip likely could not be produced without US technology and thus SMIC may have violated the Department of Commerce’s Foreign Direct Product Rule,” Gallagher said in a statement.

“The time has come to end all US technology exports to both Huawei and SMIC to make clear any firm that flouts US law and undermines our national security will be cut off from our technology.”

Huawei was placed on a trade blacklist in May 2019 over national security concerns, forcing its US suppliers and others to obtain a special licence to ship goods to it. SMIC was added to the so-called entity list in December 2020, over fears it could divert advanced technology to military users.

The trade restrictions imposed on Huawei and SMIC include the Foreign Direct Product Rule meant to bar any company anywhere in the world from using tools from the United States to manufacture a chip for Huawei.

But suppliers to Huawei and SMIC have received billions of dollars’ worth of licences to sell US technology to the companies despite their being on the trade lists. About 90% of the licences were for sales to SMIC.

The US Commerce Department’s bureau overseeing export controls did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","Sustainability Milestones in 2022

protection organizations, customers, and partners on
projects that leverage ICT to protect forests, wetlands,
and oceans.
Digital Inclusion
According to World Health Organization (WHO), more
than one billion people in the world are affected by
some sort of disability, meaning that one in every seven
people has accessibility needs.
Huawei is providing more accessibility features, giving
users more confidence and freedom to enjoy the
convenience of smart devices.
Digital Inclusion
In 2005, the United Nations called upon organizations
around the world to improve financial inclusion and
ensure that responsible and sustainable financial
services are available for all, especially those in rural
and other impoverished areas, who are often neglected
by traditional financial services.
 Huawei Mobile Money helps bridge the digital divide
through mobile communications technologies and digital
payment platforms. This solution aims to give unbanked
people access to affordable and reliable
financial services.
Digital Inclusion
The world is growing more interconnected, digital, and
intelligent. As digital assets increase, attack surfaces are
continuing to expand, security vulnerabilities are being
exploited more frequently, and cyberspace as a whole
is becoming increasingly unsecure. These are making
cyber security assurance more important than ever.
Huawei has continued to make cyber security and
privacy protection a top priority. We confront cyber
security and privacy challenges and seizing related
opportunities through management transformation,
technological innovation, and open collaboration. We are
committed to fostering a better life for all in the future
digital world by offering secure and trustworthy products,
solutions, and services.
Security and
Trustworthiness
Cyber security and privacy protection are a shared
responsibility, and all stakeholders need to tackle this
global challenge together.
Adhering to our cyber security values of integrity,
trustworthiness, capability, accountability, openness, and
transparency, we welcome more communication and
collaboration with key stakeholders to jointly improve cyber
security capabilities. Together, we can promote standards
development, conduct joint innovation, and share
knowledge and best practices to improve cyber security.
Security and
Trustworthiness
Natural disasters and emergencies, such as floods,
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and conflicts, can
damage network infrastructure and affect people's
communication, work, and lives.
It is our mission and primary social responsibility to
maintain stable network operations. We have robust
mechanisms for responding to natural disasters
and emergencies and are continuing to improve
our capabilities in this regard. This has helped us to
support network stability for customers and stable
communications for users.
Security and
Trustworthiness
In today's highly globalized and specialized world,
Huawei's operations rely heavily on third parties,
including vendors, specialist agencies, and partners. This
makes business continuity management (BCM) critical.
Through years of sustained investment, Huawei has
established a BCM system for domains such as R&D,
procurement, manufacturing, logistics, and global technical
services. This system covers our end-to-end processes,
from suppliers to Huawei and to our customers.

Risks and Opportunities Measures Sustainability
Strategy
Green and low-carbon development is now a global
priority. Stakeholders are increasingly expecting
enterprises to move towards green and low-carbon
development. Many regions, countries, and industry
organizations have released environmental regulations
and disclosure guidelines.
Huawei is proactively working to address climate and
environmental challenges. We use innovative ICT
solutions to protect our shared home by focusing on
three areas: advancing energy conservation and emissions
reduction, promoting renewable energy, and contributing
to a circular economy.
Environmental
Protection
As climate change becomes an increasingly pressing
issue, it is more important than ever to reduce
dependence on fossil fuels as a key to green
development.
At Huawei, we prioritize the use of renewable energy
in our own operations wherever possible. Our digital
power subsidiary also aims to drive an energy revolution
by focusing on clean power generation, mobility
electrification, and green ICT power infrastructure.
Environmental
Protection
Unsustainable patterns of consumption and production
are among the root causes of the triple planetary crises
of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution.
Changing our relationship with nature is key to a
sustainable future.
Huawei is committed to building a business model that
incorporates circular economy practices and a closed-loop
value chain. We are pursuing more eco-friendly materials,
more durable products, greener packaging, and less waste
throughout our product lifecycles so that all resources can
be efficiently used, reused, and recycled.
Environmental
Protection
Huawei operates in more than 170 countries and
regions. As such, hiring and nurturing local staff is an
important issue for our stakeholders.
Huawei has released the Resolutions on Strengthening
Localization Efforts, which states that localization is
part of Huawei's long-term strategy. According to the
Resolutions, Huawei should deploy as many local staff
as possible and help them fully unlock their potential,
require those engaging in global business to pass English
language certification, and provide better support and
services to local staff.
Healthy and
Harmonious
Ecosystem
With the imminent risk of an economic downturn,
many are expecting policies that spur production and
lift trade restrictions. Discriminatory policies will only
undermine free trade and global interests.
Huawei embraces free trade, open markets, and fair
competition. We will continue to support equitable and
non-discriminatory multilateral trade rules and place
trade compliance above our own commercial interests.
Healthy and
Harmonious
Ecosystem
As due diligence management is changing from
voluntary compliance to a mandatory obligation,
enterprises must find ways to avoid and address
adverse impacts on workers, human rights, and the
environment that may be associated with operations,
supply chains, and other business relationships.
Huawei has released the Global Procurement CSR Due
Diligence Regulation to guide procurement departments
at all levels to establish a risk-based, multi-layered
supplier CSR supervision process. This regulation will help
identify, prevent, mitigate, and explain the CSR risks that
Huawei's global supply chains face.
Healthy and
Harmonious
Ecosystem
In 2022, as countries around the world buckle down
for post-pandemic recovery, many have turned to
digitalization and the digital economy to address
socioeconomic challenges. Digital talent plays an
instrumental role in driving digital transformation and
unleashing digital productivity.
We are working hard to build digital skills in the countries
and regions where we operate. Back in 2008, Huawei
launched a program called Seeds for the Future to help
universities foster the next generation of digital talent.
Through this program, we are also helping upskill industry
and public sector professionals and nurture new tech
leadership, working with local communities to build basic
digital skills, and inspiring people to tackle real-world
challenges in tech competitions. To date, this program
has benefited more than 2.43 million people from over
150 countries.

This service is aligned with the upcoming EU policy developments in relation to non-financial disclosure. The British parliament’s defence committee said on Thursday (9 October) that it had found clear evidence that telecoms giant Huawei had colluded with the Chinese state and said Britain may need to remove all Huawei equipment earlier than planned.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in July ordered Huawei equipment to be purged from the nascent 5G network by the end of 2027. U.S. President Donald Trump claimed credit for the British decision.

“The West must urgently unite to advance a counterweight to China’s tech dominance,” Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the defence committee, said. “We must not surrender our national security for the sake of short-term technological development.”

The committee did not go into detail about the exact nature of the ties but said it had seen clear evidence of Huawei collusion with “the Chinese Communist Party apparatus”.

Huawei said the report lacked credibility.

“It is built on opinion rather than fact. We’re sure people will see through these groundless accusations of collusion and remember instead what Huawei has delivered for Britain over the past 20 years,” a Huawei spokesman said.

When asked about the committee’s comments, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that some in the UK should think before they speak, and that the legitimate interests of Chinese companies were being damaged.

“The openness and fairness of the UK market, as well as the security of foreign investments there, is highly concerning,” she said, speaking at a daily news conference in Beijing on Friday.

Trump identifies China as the United States’ main geopolitical rival, and has accused the Communist Party-ruled state of taking advantage over trade and not telling the truth over the novel coronavirus outbreak, which he calls the “China plague”.

Washington and its allies say Huawei technology could be used to spy for China. Huawei has repeatedly denied this, and says the United States is simply jealous of its success.

British ministers say the rise to global dominance of Huawei, founded in 1987 by a former People’s Liberation Army engineer, has caught the West off guard.

The defence committee said it supported Johnson’s decision to eventually purge Huawei from Britain’s 5G network but noted that “developments could necessitate this date being moved forward, potentially to 2025” to be economically feasible. An influential US lawmaker said on Wednesday the Commerce Department should end all technology exports to Huawei and SMIC, China’s top manufacturer of semiconductors.

Republican Mike Gallagher – chair of the House of Representatives’ committee on China, which has pressed the Biden administration to take a tougher stance on US technology sent to China – urged harsher curbs after the discovery of new chips in Huawei phones that may violate trade restrictions.

The comments from Gallagher follow news that Chinese electronics giant Huawei started selling a phone last week called the Mate 60 Pro, which contains a chip that analysts believe was made after a breakthrough by Semiconductor International Manufacturing Corp (SMIC).

“This chip likely could not be produced without US technology and thus SMIC may have violated the Department of Commerce’s Foreign Direct Product Rule,” Gallagher said in a statement.

“The time has come to end all US technology exports to both Huawei and SMIC to make clear any firm that flouts US law and undermines our national security will be cut off from our technology.”

Huawei was placed on a trade blacklist in May 2019 over national security concerns, forcing its US suppliers and others to obtain a special licence to ship goods to it. SMIC was added to the so-called entity list in December 2020, over fears it could divert advanced technology to military users.

The trade restrictions imposed on Huawei and SMIC include the Foreign Direct Product Rule meant to bar any company anywhere in the world from using tools from the United States to manufacture a chip for Huawei.

But suppliers to Huawei and SMIC have received billions of dollars’ worth of licences to sell US technology to the companies despite their being on the trade lists. About 90% of the licences were for sales to SMIC.

The US Commerce Department’s bureau overseeing export controls did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
