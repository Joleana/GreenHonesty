# GreenHonesty
We are aiming to establish whether or not the claims companies make regarding their ESG scores are legitimate or being "green-washed." This is accomplished by using AI to classify statements in their reports into how/low probabilities that their claims are false. Our technical pipeline will involve scraping company websites and using their sustainability reports to classify these claims, using sentiment analysis and a classification model. We use the ESG diagnostic parameters to identify the types of green-washing that could exist in the companies profiles.

To run the code in this repo, add company raw data to csv input file and the output path where company "raw_data", "cean_data", "classification", and "honesty_scores" can be contained
